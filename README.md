## SolidFire Puppet

# Do not use!!

This repository was the first effort at a SolidFire puppet provider. It has
now been superseeded by a much better effort avaliable on the SolidFire github
page [here](https://github.com/solidfire/solidfire-puppet). Please use it instead of this one.

Please see the [Puppet forum](http://developer.solidfire.com/forum/puppet) on
<https://developer.solidfire.com> for any issues (best effort help),
discussion, advice or if you have a contribution.
